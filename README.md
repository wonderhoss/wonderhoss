## Motivation for this Document

I have long wondered whether these personal Readmes are worth the effort. Many of them read eerily similar to each other
and often don't tell you much. Don't we all want to be excellent to each other or be there to listen? Shouldn't I try to
adapt and grow rather than expecting others to read a document and adjust their actions to me?

I decided to write one after all because I realise that despite good intentions, things are not always that easy.

I will always endeavour to be the best human being I possibly can be, but I acknowledge that at times I will fail.

If you are working with me, this document aims to help you understand my quirks and flaws.


## My Beliefs

There are a few core beliefs that underpin my thinking and decision-making. Understanding these will help you make
an argument that resonates with me.

### Data-driven Decision Making

I believe that the best way to make sound decisions is data, that there are often single, correct answers to questions
which are bourne out by data. Recognising the opportunities to use data to drive decisions should allow us to quickly
agree on a course of action and leave more time to focus on the truly hard questions.

### People are Important

Between OKRs and SLOs it is easy to forget that we are all human, that we have our own lives, thoughts and feelings.
Emotional well-being is just as important as physical well-being and I will always strive to recognise that.
People who do not feel safe or who's minds are preoccupied with life challenges will not do their best work.
Those of us struggling with mental health problems need space and support.

### Diversity Matters

Research shows that teams made up of people from diverse backgrounds produce better outcomes. I firmly believe in this principle.
I welcome the opportunity to work with anyone who is different than me and who can bring views to the table which I cannot.
I believe that diversity doesn't stop at hiring and that creating an inclusive environment that is safe for everyone requires
continuing commitment.

### There is no such Thing as Human Error

In tech we build and operate some of the most complex systems humanity has ever devised. Often these systems have
not been designed from the ground up to be the way they are, but rather have grown over time.
I believe that people come to work wanting to do the best job they can. If they make mistakes, it is because the systems
they operate have let them down. Don't ask, "Why did you press the wrong button?" but rather, "Why was there a dangerous
button and why did it seem like a good idea to press it."


## Working with Me

### On my Team

In order to make sound technical decisions it is important to have strong, well-founded opinions. It is also important to
keep an open mind.
When discussing these sorts of questions with me, I may ask for time to form an opinion before jumping straight into the
conversation. At that point I will have an opinion that makes sense to me.

Please feel free to challenge it. No single person ever has all the answers. We can only achieve the best results in our work
if we work together to arrive at the best conclusions our combined minds can muster.

I sometimes talk too much and don't listen enough. If you feel your arguments aren't being heard, please tell me so that I can
make sure to give them - and you - the space they deserve.

I love a good argument. Sometimes I will argue a point not because I care deeply about the outcome but rather purely because I
think I've got a good point to make.
It helps to articulate how strongly _you_ feel about something. If you're a 10/10 on something and I'm a 2, I will yield, no matter my personal
opinion.


### As my Manager

If you are managing me, I'd like us to be partners, focused on achieving something together.
In order to function at my best, I need both the freedom to make decisions as well as guidance as to what the right direction is.
Help me understand how what we're doing fits in with the wider organisational goals, but allow me to suggest and discuss alternative
ideas to get us there.

While I will happily write down proposals, arguments and my personal views, I find it easiest to discuss problems or disagreements
verbally and in person, so I appreciate regular face time.

I struggle with impostor syndrome at times and it helps if you give me feedback early and often. This is especially true if things
are going well as my brain will happily fill in the gaps with doom and gloom.

I care deeply about the people I work with. Ensuring everybody can be themselves and give their best is everyone's responsibility.


### Reporting to me

If you're reporting to me in some capacity, my primary aim is to be an asset to you, someone to help you get done what you need
to get done. So first and foremost, I need you to communicate.
Let me know what you are struggling with, even if you don't know how or even whether I could help.

You can expect regular face time with me to discuss anything that's on your mind, but I will always be happy to make time if
there's anything that can't wait.


## Contributing

Feedback from others is incredibly important in the quest to become a better human. I value feedback in any form it may take.
At the same time, I know that giving and receiving feedback is one of the hardest things to do.

If you have feedback to share with me, it is up to you to pick the format and venue you feel most comfortable with. If I have
wronged you, please let me know as soon as you are able so that I have a chance to reexamine the thought process that lead to it.

In group settings like meetings I am happy to receive feedback publicly and immediately, especially if it might help produce better outcomes
from the session.

In my experience feedback you give me is most effective if it is specific and actionable. If you choose to give me such feedback, I will commit to
following up with you after some time to review these actionables.
